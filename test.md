# Test MD file

This is a file to show that I can create and edit a markdown file. 

In this file, I will demonstrate that I can add various types of content to the file, such as:
- text
- lists (I'm doing this right now!)
- links
- code snippets  
- images


## URL link
Here is a link to the [lab session details](https://geog-510.gishub.org/book/labs/lab_01.html) that I created this repository for.

## Code
Here's a small Python snippet that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while sequence[-1] + sequence[-2] < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    return sequence

print(fibonacci(50))
```
This code defines a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number and prints the result.

## Images 
Here is an image of a cartoon beagle! He's cute, isn't he?
